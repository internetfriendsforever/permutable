    <h1>Permutable</h1>

    <p>
      A framework for exploring and composing graphics in the browser. Written in JavaScript with zero dependencies – it is <a href="https://github.com/internetfriendsforever/permutable">open-source</a> and weighs around ~32 kB uncompressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      permutable (pəˈmjuːtəb<sup>ə</sup>l) <em>adjective</em> <em>able to be changed or exchanged</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>What does it do?</h2>

    <p>
      Permutable has two different runtimes. Programs you write are compatible with both, so you can easily switch based on what mode you are in.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="api.html#run-function">run</a> gives you a minimal user interface with controls for the parameters you set up in your program. This runtime is good for exploring and developing single programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="api.html#mix-function">mix</a> gives you an interface for composing and controlling multiple programs with a single output. This runtime is good for composing and layering programs, and for performing live.
    </p>

    <p>
      Permutable tries to get out of your way, shorten the feedback loop, and to let you explore and work with your ideas.
    </p>

    <h2>What does it <em>not</em> do?</h2>

    <p>
      Permutable does not have an opinion on what or how you draw. It does not have any built in functions for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arc#Drawing_a_full_circle">drawing full circles</a> or perfect squares.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are free to draw using <em>either</em> the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a> which provides a means for drawing 2D graphics via JavaScript, or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL API</a> when you need to draw high-performance 3D and 2D graphics. Both APIs use the HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.
    </p>

    <p>
      Permutable is not designed for mobile, although it might be usable in some cases.
